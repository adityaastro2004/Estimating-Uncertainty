Aim : To find an appropriate confidence interval in which the Mean of the Actual underlying Unknown Distribution is 
present; saying it to be true mean.

In the meeting, we have discussed 5 different approaches to find the the confidence interval as described above.

1. Standard Normal
2. Student-t Distribution
3. Bootstrap-t Distribution
4. Percentile Method
5. BCA Method

I will be making simulations for 1, 2 and 3.

General assumptions made while coding 1, 2, 3:
1. 1000 Bootstrap samples will be made for the given sample of data.
2. Considering mean to be the statistic of interest.
